# Todo

- complete meta functions
- ensure local repo read uses single repo function (keep it dry!)
- ensure service methods return copy of repo
- ensure local repos load correctly. Currently some load with . repoName (seems to happen on in parallel mode!)
- remove github repo limit (due to graphql response limit)
- add hash for head commit as repo alias
- write limitations in readme
  - local repos must have unique repo names, regardless of folder structure2
